# C Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to my C Programming Projects repository! This repository is a collection of various projects and code examples written in the C programming language. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn C or an experienced programmer seeking inspiration, you'll find a variety of projects here to explore and contribute to.

## Projects Included
- Number Guessing Game: In this C program, players are prompted to guess a secret number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low until they correctly guess the secret number.
- Rock Paper Scissors Game: In this C program, two players make simultaneous choices of 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors.' The program determines the winner based on the rules of the game, where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
- Tic Tac Toe Game: In this C program, two players take turns to place their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game, while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
